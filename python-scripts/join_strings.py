# In Python, there are a variety of ways to join string values. This is called string concatenation.

# The ‘+’ operator is the simplest way to combine two string values in Python.

# To learn how to connect two strings, build a python script with the following script.

# Two string values are allocated to two variables, with a third variable used to store the joined values, which will be printed later.
